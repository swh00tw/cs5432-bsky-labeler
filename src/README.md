# Bluesky labeler starter code
You'll find the starter code for Assignment 3 in this repository. More detailed
instructions can be found in the assignment spec.

## The Python ATProto SDK
To build your labeler, you'll be using the AT Protocol SDK, which is documented [here](https://atproto.blue/en/latest/).

## Automated labeler
The bulk of your Part I implementation will be in `automated_labeler.py`. You are
welcome to modify this implementation as you wish. However, you **must**
preserve the signatures of the `__init__` and `moderate_post` functions,
otherwise the testing/grading script will not work. You may also use the
functions defined in `label.py`. You can import them like so:
```
from .label import post_from_url
```

For Part II, you will create a file called `policy_proposal_labeler.py` for your
implementation. You are welcome to create additional files as you see fit.

## Input files
For Part I, your labeler will have as input lists of T&S words/domains, news
domains, and a list of dog pictures. These inputs can be found in the
`labeler-inputs` directory. For testing, we have CSV files where the rows
consist of URLs paired with the expected labeler output. These can be found
under the `test-data` directory.

## Testing
We provide a testing harness in `test-labeler.py`. To test your labeler on the
input posts for dog pictures, you can run the following command and expect to
see the following output:

```
% python test_labeler.py labeler-inputs test-data/input-posts-dogs.csv
The labeler produced 20 correct labels assignments out of 20
Overall ratio of correct label assignments 1.0
```
